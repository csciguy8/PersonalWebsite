                  <p>A simple enough question... </p>
                  <p>I was asked this in April 2011. Would I be willing to make a soundtrack for an iPhone game in development? Sounded easy enough, I've been a musician all my life, how hard could it be? But then again, I'm a professional programmer, not a composer. Also, I've never written a soundtrack before. </p>
                  <p>Heck, why not dive in anyway?</p>

                  <p>I  began by writing a series of various musical &quot;prototypes&quot;, each about 1 minute in length. Each one led to discussion about the mood it conveyed, what we wanted it to sound like more, what we wanted it to sound like less, and eventually led to more prototypes. Throughout, I thought the  universe needed to have a tie in with electronic music. Robots, energy, the future, AI... we already associate these things with synthesizers, electronic beats, buzzy / raspy tones. As far as musical style, it was all fair game, techno, pop, reggae, jazz, the more unique, the better. So I wrote, and wrote, and wrote...</p>
                  <p>... and 14 prototypes later, we had a pretty good idea of what we wanted to hear. We didn't want the usual &quot;drum machine techno&quot; inspired style that you'd hear from a stereotypical arcade game. We also didn't want anything too tradional. We wanted to stand out and give a unique character to the game. What we started with in &quot;Welcome to Emission Control&quot; was something starting to fit the bill. It had a unique lead instrument, the accordion. It also had a mix of the electronic beats and tango-esque sections. It was different,  and we liked this.                </p>

                  <p>Serious work on the project didn't actually start until August 1st. After all, in the beginning, you never know if a project is worthy enough to commit to, or even if you are <em>able</em> to commit. And that's what production meant to me, setting a start and end date (even if arbitrary) and delivering something tangible at the end.</p>
                  <p>The goal: 3 background soundtracks, each 3-5 minutes long, to be completed in one month.</p>
                  <p>It didn't sound like much at first, but then when I thought about it, it was a lot of work. Even though we had many prototypes to start from, they were not finished songs. Each one required a pass to compose the music, decide on instrumentation, record, mix, and master. Also, I had never composed music of that length before. Nor had I been through a mixing or mastering process. Suddenly 4 weeks sounded very short.</p>
                  <p>In the end, the project actually took 5 weeks, a 25% slip in schedule, which I was thrilled about, considering all the unknowns. I learned a great amount about all aspects of the production process. And in the end, the finished product became more than this particular video game's soundtrack. It became the start of the soundtrack for the whole universe. The music will continue to evolve as more time is put into it, more songs are added, and as the universe unfolds.                </p>
